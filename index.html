        ‚ù§Please receive everything on this page in love‚ù§
        Please read everything on this page carefully and respond that you understand along with the requested information after you have read this. The requested reading is for spiritual guidance and advice. You the recipient is to, in NO WAY, use that information to do any physical, spiritual or mental harm to someone else. Furthermore, I am not responsible or liable for any actions you or your person may take before or after receiving your reading. I am not a lisenced medical, legal or financial specialist, and in no way can replace one.  
        
        ‚ú¥ I WILL NOT READ ABOUT THE FOLLOWING‚ú¥
        Physical death: Yours or anyone else's, in addition I will not reach out to deceased loved ones to give you messages from them. Please see a medium for that.
        Pregnancy: However, if I see childbirth in your future, I may volunteer that information at my discresion
        Health Issues: Physical or mental, please see a licensed practitioner
        Jail or legal outcomes: However, I will offer limited spiritual advise.
        
        I will get to your personal reading as soon as possible. Readings are conducting via voice memo or video recording, so please provide an email address to send your reading to. However, there are times I may need to tap further into your energy and will ask to speak to you over the phone, you can save time by providing your phone number when you respond to this disclaimer.
        
        Please provide me with what you would like your reading to be about in detail, your sun sign and any background info you can provide. A picture  of yourself (and your person if this is a love reading), can help with my meditation and to set my intention. I WILL NOT SHARE YOUR PICS AND PERSONAL INFO.
        
        EXAMPLE READING REQUEST: "Tell me what my future spouse is like and will my career be successful?" ü§ó 
        
        ‚ú¥Please keep in mind the following very important things‚ú¥
        1.Time is fluid: Some events may not have yet happened
        
        2. Everyone has FREE WILL: Tarot is here to guide and give advice, NOT to make your decisions FOR you and regardless of someone's "intentions", it is their own FREE WILL  that will determine what they actually do. Therefore, outcomes should be considered possible and not "guaranteed". 
        
        3. I will read the messages and energies that come, I will remain in a positive state of mind and call in spirits of light and love only... but I will not ever intentionally lie nor will I tell you just what you want to hear.
        
        4. There is no gender in tarot, only feminine and masculine energies which we all possess.
        
        5. I NEED YOUR FEEDBACK. Though I have a very successful track record, growing and learning is a part of my journey! 
        
        6. READINGS ARE NO LONGER FREE. I appreciate all donations. PLEASE PUT "GIFT" IN THE MEMO. PLEASE DONATE BEFORE YOUR READING IS DONE. Please send to my sister/assistant Curlena by using paypal with this email illuminatedone1111@gmail.com or cash app with $ladyroyal77 (There are no refunds for donations).
        
        I appreciate you so very much and I send you peace, light and love! Hope to hear from you soon, so I can get started on your reading.
        
        Sincerely, 
        Bright Light‚ú¥
